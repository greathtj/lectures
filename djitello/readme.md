The files saved here are codes used in a lesson on how to control the DJI Tello drone using Python. By testing each one in order, you can follow along with the entire lesson smoothly. 

Try modifying the code as you go to match your own drone and Wi-Fi setup. And don’t be afraid to mix and match pieces from each code into new ones! You might end up creating some amazing code that includes your own unique ideas.

Remember, everyone—following along step by step is how we learn. But the ultimate goal isn’t just to copy; it’s to bring *your* ideas to life. Coding is something you do because you want to try making something yourself. 

So, what do *you* want to make?
